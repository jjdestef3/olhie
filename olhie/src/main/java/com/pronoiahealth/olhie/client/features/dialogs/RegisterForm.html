								John Milton John Milton John Milton was born in London on
								December 9, 1608, into a middle-class family. He was educated at
								St. Paul's School, then at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he
								began to write poetry in Latin, Italian, and English, and
								prepared to enter the clergy. After university, however, he
								abandoned his plans to join the priesthood and spent the next
								six years in his father's country home in Buckinghamshire
								following a rigorous course of independent study to prepare for
								a career as a poet. His extensive reading included both
								classical and modern works of religion, science, philosophy,
								history, politics, and literature. In addition, Milton was
								proficient in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and
								Italian, and obtained a familiarity with Old English and Dutch
								as well. During his period of private study, Milton composed a
								number of poems, including "On the Morning of Christ's
								Nativity," "On Shakespeare," "L'Allegro," "Il Penseroso," and
								the pastoral elegy "Lycidas." In May of 1638, Milton began a
								13-month tour of France and Italy, during which he met many
								important intellectuals and influential people, including the
								astronomer Galileo, who appears in Milton's tract against
								censorship, "Areopagitica." In 1642, Milton returned from a trip
								into the countryside with a 16-year-old bride, Mary Powell. Even
								though they were estranged for most of their marriage, she bore
								him three daughters and a son before her death in 1652. Milton
								later married twice more: Katherine Woodcock in 1656, who died
								giving birth in 1658, and Elizabeth Minshull in 1662. During the
								English Civil War, Milton championed the cause of the Puritans
								and Oliver Cromwell, and wrote a series of pamphlets advocating
								radical political topics including the morality of divorce, the
								freedom of the press, populism, and sanctioned regicide. Milton
								served as secretary for foreign languages in Cromwell's
								government, composing official statements defending the
								Commonwealth. During this time, Milton steadily lost his
								eyesight, and was completely blind by 1651. He continued his
								duties, however, with the aid of Andrew Marvell and other
								assistants. After the Restoration of Charles II to the throne in
								1660, Milton was arrested as a defender of the Commonwealth,
								fined, and soon released. He lived the rest of his life in
								seclusion in the country, completing the blank-verse epic poem
								Paradise Lost in 1667, as well as its sequel Paradise Regained
								and the tragedy Samson Agonistes both in 1671. Milton oversaw
								the printing of a second edition of Paradise Lost in 1674, which
								included an explanation of "why the poem rhymes not," clarifying
								his use of blank verse, along with introductory notes by
								Marvell. He died shortly afterwards, on November 8, 1674, in
								Buckinghamshire, England. Paradise Lost, which chronicles
								Satan's temptation of Adam and Eve and their expulsion from
								Eden, is widely regarded as his masterpiece and one of the
								greatest epic poems in world literature. Since its first
								publication, the work has continually elicited debate regarding
								its theological themes, political commentary, and its depiction
								of the fallen angel Satan who is often viewed as the protagonist
								of the work. The epic has had wide-reaching effect, inspiring
								other long poems, such as Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock,
								William Wordsworth's The Prelude and John Keats's Endymion, as
								well as Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein, and deeply
								influencing the work of Percy Bysshe Shelley and William Blake,
								who illustrated an edition of the epic. A Selected Bibliography
