		<h2>What We're Working On</h2>
		<div style="width: 100%; height: 520px; overflow: auto;">
			<p>
				<strong><u>Refactoring code to provide better
						persistence abstraction</u></strong>
			<p>
				<strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp;<font color="green">In this
					build</font>
			</p>
			</p>

			<p>
				<font color="green">This will allow us to "plug-in" other
					databases and search technology (i.e. integration with OHT
					repository projects, potential change to Mongo-Elastisearch,
					etc..). We didn't want to get to far along without doing this as
					the longer we wait the more difficult it will be. </font>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><u>Enhance the log out tracking</u></strong>
			<p>
				<strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp;<font color="green">In this
					build</font>
			</p>
			</p>


			<p>
				<font color="green">The fix we put in 2 weeks ago does not
					work with web-kit browsers. Chrome and Safari don't allow
					asynchronous events to complete in the onWindowClosing method thus
					the system never gets the log out message. We have a fix using a
					synchronous call implemented with jQuery. This will require the use
					of GWT native methods.</font>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><u>Put the list of things we're working on on
						the home page</u></strong>
			<p>
				<strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp;<font color="green">In this
					build</font>
			</p>
			</p>

			<p>
				<font color="green">This will be the first of more "portlets"
					we will use on the front page. It will require additional work on
					the database to store the data that will drive the display as well
					as the development of a portlet template.</font>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><u>Performanace improvements:</u></strong>
			<p>
				<strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp;<font color="green">1. in this
					build. Used on the search screen. Compare this with the bookcase
					display.</font>
			</p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li><font color="green">1. Pre-built images of books on
						the server. That way we can control to size of the download for
						the display and the front end will not need to create the image on
						the fly. This may result in slightly less detailed images but
						provide a more consistent display with lees waiting for the user</font></li>
				<li>2. Scrollable search results return. Only bring back as
					many results as the user can see in the view. As the user scrolls
					in the view bring back additional results. This will provide a
					faster initial display.</li>
				<li>3. Load the bookcase panels (My Books, Books I'm
					Co-Authoring, Books I Like) separately when the user navigates to
					the panel. Again, this will improve the initial response time.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><u>Usability improvements:</u></strong>
			<p>
				<strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp;<font color="green">1. is in
					this build</font>
			</p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li><font color="green">1. Better spinner so the user
						knows the system is working.</font></li>
				<li>2. Add features to the visual book display so a user can
					download and view assets right for the book as opposed to having to
					go to the book detail page to do that.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><u>Implement Co-Author workflow</u></strong>
			</p>
			<p>This will require a way for authors to lookup potential
				co-authors and send them a message. We'll need a way for the
				co-author to respond to the request and the author to approve of
				deny the response from the co-author. At this time we will be
				implementing the user story where the author initiates the request.
				At some later date we can implement the user story where the
				co-author initiates the request to the author.</p>
